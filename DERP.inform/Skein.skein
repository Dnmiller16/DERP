You wake up and realize that you have become considerably dumber and that you have the brain function and motor skills of a three year old. You think that it may be the large ammount of meth that you have been smoking. Anyhow you notice that everything around you is white and that you can barely move around or walk straight. After much thought you realize that you must get out of here before you go insane or die.
