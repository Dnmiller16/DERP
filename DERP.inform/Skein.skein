You wake up and realize that you have become considerably dumber and that your brain function and motor skills are a bit off. You think that it may be because of the large amount of meth that you have been smoking. Anyhow you notice that everything around you is white and that you can barely move around or walk straight. After much thought you realize that you must get out of here before you go insane or die.
