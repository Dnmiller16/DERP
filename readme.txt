How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
I think that i did a very good job of converting my idea for this game into the game itself.

Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
One time when i got stuck was when i was trying to create a puzzle where the player must put on bubble wrap before they can move to different rooms. I solved this problem by myself by adding a line of code similar to one from my last game that world read the players command and if it contained a direction and the player was not wearing bubble wrap, the player would be killed.

Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
1. you must find 4 different elixirs and combine them into a magic potion to make yourself smart enough to open the first door.

2. You must find glue and put it on your hand to open a door with no handle.

3. you must decode a riddle and find a pin to pick the lock on a door.

4. (extra) you must find and put on bubble wrap to be able to move to different rooms from the starting room.

Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
All of the puzzles fit into the game and almost every possible command gives a response which makes the story flow better.

Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
I had chris and kouske test my game which helped me to make certain things have responses (which didn’t before) and also to try to work hints into the game so it was not too hard.

How did their feedback affect your game? 
^

Whose game did you beta test? 
chris and kouske

What feedback were you able to give?
most of my feedback about having objects that were described in descriptions not giving responses. I also commented about gameplay mechanics that did not work right or felt weird.

What are you most proud of?
I am proud of my entire game because i worked very hard on it and it came out very well.

What would you do differently next time?
Possibly have different puzzles or make the hints and solutions less subtle.
